# WHMCS Node Module

This module allows you to remotely manage your WHMCS installation(s) using Node.

## Installation

```shell
npm install whmcs-js
```

## Usage

**Reminder: You need to whitelist the IP from which you are making API calls in WHMCS. Otherwise you will get an error.**

You can do this under *Setup > General Settings > Security*. [More info](https://developers.whmcs.com/api/access-control/)

### Configuring

You can remotely identify on the API using two methods: *Note that you will always need to declare serverUrl*

#### With `username` and `password`

```javascript
const config = {
  username: 'api_username',
  password: 'password_as_md5',
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1/includes/api.php' // Remember to point to the api.php file
}
```

#### With `identifier` and `secret`

You can generate these under *Setup > Staff Management > Manage API Credentials*. [More info](https://docs.whmcs.com/API_Authentication_Credentials#Creating_Admin_API_Authentication_Credentials)

```javascript
const config = {
  identifier: 'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz',
  secret: 'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz',
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1/includes/api.php' // Remember to point to the api.php file
}
```

### Making calls

Every request returns a Promise with JSON data, so you can do:

```javascript
const { Billing } = require('whmcs-js')

const myBilling = new Billing(config)

const invoices = await myBilling.getInvoices()
```
